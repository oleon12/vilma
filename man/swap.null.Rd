\title{Randomly Swap Cells in a Presence-Absence Matrix}
\usage{
swap.null(mat, n_swaps = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{mat}{A numeric matrix of 0s and 1s representing species presence-absence.}

\item{n_swaps}{Number of attempted swaps to perform.
Defaults to \code{5 * nrow(mat) * ncol(mat)}.}
}
\value{
A matrix of the same dimensions as \code{mat}, with swapped entries.
}
\description{
Performs null-model swaps on a presence-absence matrix by randomly exchanging
species occurrences between cells. Only swaps that preserve row and column totals
(checkerboard swaps) are allowed.
}
\details{
This function is commonly used in null model analyses for community ecology.
It randomly selects two rows and two columns, checks for a checkerboard pattern,
and swaps the occurrences to preserve species richness and cell totals.
Only 2x2 submatrices matching the checkerboard patterns
\code{[1, 0; 0, 1]} or \code{[0, 1; 1, 0]} are swapped.
