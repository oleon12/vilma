\arguments{
\item{tree}{A rooted phylogenetic tree of class \code{phylo}, with branch lengths.}

\item{dist}{An object of class \code{vilma.dist}, typically produced by
\code{points.to.raster()}, containing species distribution data.}

\item{mpd.method}{Character string specifying how to handle single-species cells in MPD.
Options are:
\itemize{
\item \code{"root"} – For cells with single species, uses distance from root to taxon.
\item \code{"node"} – For cells with single species, uses branch length to nearest ancestral node.
\item \code{"exclude"} – Excludes single-species cells from calculations (default).
}}

\item{abundance}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, weights MPD by relative species abundances
within each cell. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{iterations}{Integer. Number of randomizations for the null model (default = 999).}

\item{sampling}{Character. Randomization strategy for null model:
\itemize{
\item \code{"taxa.label"} – Permutes species labels on the tree.
\item \code{"range"} – Randomizes species ranges using swap algorithms.
\item \code{"neighbor"} – Swaps species occurrences between adjacent cells.
\item \code{"regional"} – Assembles communities by drawing from a regional pool.
}}

\item{n.directions}{Character. Neighborhood adjacency definition for
\code{"neighbor"} method. Options: \code{"rook"}, \code{"bishop"}, or \code{"queen"}
(default = \code{"queen"}).}

\item{regional.weight}{Character. Weighting scheme for species in the regional null model:
\itemize{
\item \code{"uniform"} – All species have equal probability.
\item \code{"frequency"} – Weighted by the number of records per species.
\item \code{"range"} – Weighted by the number of unique cells occupied.
}}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{vilma.pd}, which is a list containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{distribution} – Original species distribution.
\item \code{grid} – The reference raster grid.
\item \code{pd.table} – Data frame with cells, species richness, and NRI values.
\item \code{rasters} – List with abundance, richness, and NRI rasters.
\item \code{calculation.method} – Method used for single-species cells in MPD.
\item \code{abundance} – Logical, whether abundance-weighting was applied.
\item \code{index} – The string \code{"nri.calc"}.
}

\description{
Computes the Net Relatedness Index (NRI) for communities (grid cells) based on
phylogenetic structure. NRI is derived from the standardized effect size (SES)
of the Mean Pairwise Distance (MPD) under a null model, with the sign inverted so
that positive values indicate phylogenetic clustering and negative values indicate
phylogenetic overdispersion.
}
\details{
The Net Relatedness Index (NRI) is defined as:
\deqn{NRI = - \frac{MPD_{obs} - \mu(MPD_{null})}{\sigma(MPD_{null})}}
Positive NRI values indicate that species within communities are more
closely related (phylogenetic clustering) than expected under the null model.
Negative NRI values indicate that species are less related (phylogenetic overdispersion).

NRI is computed at the \code{"cell"} level, returning results per grid cell,
including a raster of NRI values for visualization.

tree <- examplae_tree()
