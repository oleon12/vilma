\usage{
mntd.calc(tree, dist, method = c("root", "node", "exclude"), abundance = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{A rooted phylogenetic tree of class \code{phylo} with branch lengths.
For methods \code{"root"} and \code{"node"}, the tree must be rooted.}

\item{dist}{An object of class \code{vilma.dist}, typically produced by
\code{points.to.raster()}, containing the species distribution data.}

\item{method}{Character string specifying how to handle single-species cells. Options are:
\itemize{
\item \code{"root"} – For cells with single species, uses distance from root to taxon for single-species cells.
\item \code{"node"} – For cells with single species, uses branch length to the nearest ancestral node.
\item \code{"exclude"} – Excludes single-species cells from calculations (default).
}}

\item{abundance}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, weights pairwise distances by relative species abundances
within each cell. Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{vilma.pd}, which is a list containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{distribution} – Original species distribution.
\item \code{grid} – The reference raster grid.
\item \code{pd.table} – Data frame with cells, species richness, and MPD values.
\item \code{rasters} – List with abundance, richness, and MNTD rasters.
\item \code{calculation.method} – Method used for single-species cells.
\item \code{abundance} – Logical, whether abundance-weighting was applied.
\item \code{index} – The string \code{"mntd.calc"}.
}
}
\description{
Computes the Mean Nearest Taxon Distance (MNTD) among species within spatial cells
based on a phylogenetic tree and species distribution data.
The function allows different treatments of single-species cells and can optionally
incorporate species abundances.
}
\details{
MNTD is calculated as the average phylogenetic distance from each species in a community (cell)
to its closest relative (nearest neighbor) within the same community.
When \code{abundance = TRUE}, MNTD is weighted by the relative abundance of each species,
such that dominant taxa contribute more to the index than rare taxa.

If a cell contains only one species, treatment depends on the \code{method} argument.

\examples{
\dontrun{
tree <- examplae_tree()
dist <- example_dist()
dist <- points_to_raster(dist)

# Calculate abundance-unweighted MNTD
result <- mntd.calc(tree = tree, dist = dist, method = "exclude")

print(result)
plot(result)
view.vilma(result)

# Calculate abundance-weighted MNTD
result_ab <- mntd.calc(tree = tree, dist = dist, 
                      method = "exclude", abundance = TRUE)
}
