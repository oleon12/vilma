\title{Rao's Q (within-community) phylogenetic diversity}
\usage{
rao.calc(tree, dist, abundance = FALSE, scale01 = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{A rooted phylogenetic tree of class \code{phylo} with branch lengths.}

\item{dist}{An object of class \code{vilma.dist} (e.g., from \code{points.to.raster()}),
whose \code{$distribution} contains at least \code{Cell} and \code{Sp}, and whose
\code{$grid} is used to rasterize outputs.}

\item{abundance}{Logical. If \code{FALSE} (default), a presence–absence Cell×Sp
table is used (each species weighted equally within a cell). If \code{TRUE},
the Cell×Sp counts from \code{table(Cell, Sp)} are used to compute within-cell
relative abundances.}

\item{scale01}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} (default), the patristic distance matrix
is divided by its maximum off-diagonal so that \eqn{D \in [0,1]} (diagonal set
to 0). Under this scaling, RaoQ lies in \eqn{[0,1]} up to numerical tolerance.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{vilma.pd}:
\itemize{
\item \code{distribution} – Original \code{dist$distribution}.
\item \code{grid} – Original \code{dist$grid}.
\item \code{pd.table} – Data frame with columns:
\code{Cell} (cell id), \code{SR} (species richness), and \code{PD} (RaoQ).
\item \code{rasters} – List with \code{ab.raster}, \code{r.raster}, and
\code{pd.raster} (RaoQ per cell).
\item \code{calculation.method} – Character summary of the settings.
\item \code{index} – The string \code{"rao"}.

\description{
Computes Rao’s quadratic entropy (RaoQ) per spatial cell from a rooted
phylogenetic tree and a \code{vilma.dist} distribution. RaoQ is the expected
phylogenetic dissimilarity between two individuals randomly drawn from the
same community (cell), using patristic distances from the tree.
}
\details{
Species are intersected between \code{tree$tip.label} and \code{dist$distribution$Sp};
only the common species are used. The patristic matrix \eqn{D} is computed with
\code{ape::cophenetic.phylo()} and then \strong{reindexed to match the column order of
the community matrix} to ensure correct behavior under taxa-label null models.

For each cell, let \eqn{p} be the vector of within-cell relative abundances
(or presence–absence proportions). RaoQ is computed as \eqn{Q = p^\top D p}.
Empty cells (no species) are returned as \code{NA}.
}
\section{Interpretation}{

Larger RaoQ indicates greater within-community phylogenetic dispersion.
With \code{scale01 = TRUE}, values are comparable across trees (range approx. \code{[0,1]}).
